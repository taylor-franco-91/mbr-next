A high-converting website rebuilt with **React + Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Live Demo
https://mbr-next.vercel.app/

## Highlights
- App Router (Next.js), client + server components
- Smooth unlock flow, section jump, reduced-motion friendly animations
- Before/After slider with labels
- Premium purchase section (value stack, guarantee, trust badges)
- Accessible, responsive, mobile-first

## Why this project matters
This project marks my leap from static HTML/CSS/JavaScript builds into modern, production-ready development with React and Next.js. 
It challenged me to think in components, prioritize accessibility, and deliver a responsive, polished UI that feels premium. 
Along the way, I solved real-world deployment issues with Vercel and ESLint, proving I can handle the workflows engineers deal with every day. 
More than a demo, this project demonstrates that I can take an idea from concept to launch and deliver code that’s reliable, maintainable, and a product that’s ready for users.
